# Sign Detection Project

This project aims to develop a sign detection system specifically designed for mute and deaf individuals. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and interpret various signs commonly used by mute and deaf people.

## Features

- Sign Detection: The system can detect and recognize a wide range of signs.
- Real-time Processing: The system operates in real-time, allowing for immediate feedback and response to the user's signs.
- User-friendly Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface that enables easy interaction and communication for both the user and the system.

## Tech stack
 - Reactjs , tainwindcss : Frontend
 -  Flask : Backend
 - Tensorflow , CNN , Media pipe , Opencv, Kaggle datasets,
 Handdetector library from python : ML model

## Getting Started

To get started with the sign detection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Go to Frontend and write `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` to start the frontend server
4. Go to backend.
5. python  Cameraapp.py
6. Also run python Custom_camera.py to an another terminal
7. Now it is good to go for run
